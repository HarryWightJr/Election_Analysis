## Overview of Election Audit
After finding results on election data on for the candidates in the election (how many votes each candidate recieved, percentage of the votes, and who was the winner) our clients came back and asked us to return the same values on the counties involved as well. Our clients asked us to retrieve similar data to the candidate data. In this we were tasked to find the county with the largest turn out, how many votes were cast in each county, and what percentage of the total votes each county accounted for. 

## Election Audit Results

## Election Audit Summary
With the code provided, and a few modifications, this data can be used to account for any election that the election commission wishes to analyze. One modification that could be made is to add another code to find out how many votes each county gave to each candidate. This way you could tally by how much each candidate won in each county. This could be further expanded into something like the presidential election where each county's votes are accumulated to know which candidate won the popular vote in each county and the state as a whole. We could also add code that would print out the information in an easy to read graph for the casual viewrs to understand the data at a glance.
